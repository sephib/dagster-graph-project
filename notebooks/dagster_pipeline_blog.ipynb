    "* Working in the Intelligence arena we try to 'connect the dots' to extract meaningful information from data.\n",
    "* We analyze various datasets to link between them in a logical manner.\n",
    "* This is useful in many different projects - so we needed to build a pipeline that can be both dynamic and robust, and be readily and easily  utilized.\n",
    "* In this blog post we share our experience in running one of our data pipelines with  [dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/) - which uses a modern approach (compared to the traditional Airflow / Luigi task managers), see [Dagster's website description](https://docs.dagster.io/docs/learn)\n",
    "* We hope this blog post will help others to adopt such a data-pipeline and allow them to learn from our experiences.  "

    "## Our Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connecting the dots\n",
    "* Finding relationships between different entities can be challenging (especially across datasets) - but is vital when building a reliable intelligent report.  \n",
    "* A logical structure to store the entities and their relationships is in a [Graph Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). In this example we are going to use [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) DB for storing the graph.   \n",
    "* Also we are going to use _psedo BigData_. However the pipeline that we are presenting generates billions of relationships.  \n",
    "* The outcome files of the pipeline will be in the format that will allow to use the dedicated [Neo4j tool for bulk import](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.1/tools/import/).   In the future we will do a separate blog post on our data analysis workflow with `Neo4j`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First take  \n",
    "* Our initial version for our pipeline was based on custom code and configurations (YAML) files.       \n",
    "*  The code base is a combination of R and Python script that utilize Spark, Dask and HDFS.  \n",
    "*  A shell script aggregated all the scripts to run the entire workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inspect and Adapt\n",
    "After our initial alpha version we noticed that we had some problems that required our attention:  \n",
    "* The pipeline was built horizontally (per process) and not vertically (per dataset) - leading to uncertainty and fragmented results  \n",
    "* We needed to refactor our code in order to stabilize and verify the quality of the product.  \n",
    "* Working with [dask](www.dask.org) didn't solve all of our use-cases and so we needed to run some workloads on [spark](https://spark.apache.org/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After checking several options we chose `dagster` as our pipeline framework for numerous reasons - including:  \n",
    "1. Simplicity logic/framework  \n",
    "2. Modern architecture with data as a \"first class citizen\".  \n",
    "3. Open-source code base   \n",
    "4. The framework includes a modern UI for monitoring and communicating the workflow status  \n",
    "5. Pipeline supports data dependencies (and not function outputs)    \n",
    "6. Ability to log/monitor metrics   \n",
    "\n",
    "It was fortunate that our configuration files allowed us to identify the various functions and abstract our business logic from the data transformation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*** This is a `dagster` _intermediate level_ blog post - for newbees it is recommended to run through the [beginner tutorial](https://docs.dagster.io/docs/tutorial) on the dagster's site.   \n"

    "\n",
    "* At the core we have `solids` - these are the various \"functional unit of computation that consumes and produces data assets\".  \n",
    "* The `solids` can be aggregated into `composite solids`.   \n",

    "    * resources - configuration file that manges the resources for the running pipeline  \n",
    "    * solids - configuration file for the `composite solids`. Each data source has its own configuration, in addition to the composite solid that implements the creation of the Neo4j DB.  \n",

    "## Some Tips \n",
    "Once we managed to *_grok_* our understanding of `dagster` and wrap our pyspark functions, our workflow was quite productive.  Here are some tips to make your onboarding easier:  \n",
    "1. When working with Spark:   \n",
    "    1. Run a [cache](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#cache) when returning a `spark dataframe` from a `solid`. This will prevent running the `DAG` in complex pipeline that has various outputs.   \n",
    "    3. Since we had various checkpoints where we needed to dump our datasets, we found that when our `spark` performed unexpectedly, braking up the pipeline by reading back the output file (instead of passing on the dataframe object) allowed spark to manage its resources in an optimal manner.\n",
    "    2. Since our environment is on a CDH, the iteration of building a pipeline was enhanced when combining a `jupyter notebook` that would implement each step in the `composite solid`     \n",
    "2. Dagster:  \n",
    "    1. Remember to set [DAGSTER_HOME](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/instances/dagster-instance) once you are becoming serious\n",

These include, among others, [Test framework](https://docs.dagster.io/docs/learn/guides/testing/testing),  [Materialization](https://docs.dagster.io/docs/apidocs/solids#dagster.Materialization) for persistent artifacts in the pipeline and  a  [scheduler](https://docs.dagster.io/docs/apidocs/schedules#dagster.schedule). Unfortunately thses topics are outside the scope of this post.  \n",

In this process we were able to improve the quality of our pipeline and enable new data sources to quickly be integrated in our product in a frectioness manner.  \n",
